# Update for Thunderbird 102

This section covers the required update steps for add-ons which are already compatible with Thunderbird 91 and need to be made compatible with Thunderbird 102.

## Changes in Thunderbird Core

Thunderbird WebExtensions can still run legacy code inside [Experiments](../../mailextensions/#experiment-apis). Such legacy code has to be adjusted to changes made in Thunderbird Core. All known changes are listed in the following document:

* [Changes in Thunderbird 92-102](adapt-to-changes-in-thunderbird-92-102.md)

If you have encountered a change which is not yet listed there, please [contact us](../../community.md), so we can update the list.

## Changes in Shared Experiments

If you are using any of the shared Experiments, you probably do not have to update them on your own. Check if an updated version is already available:

* [Shared Experiments on DTN](../../mailextensions/#sharing-experiment-apis)
