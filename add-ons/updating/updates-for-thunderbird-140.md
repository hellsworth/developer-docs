# Updates for Thunderbird 140

Modern WebExtensions are generally stable and do not require ongoing updates to remain compatible. For Experiment add-ons, the number of potential changes in Thunderbirdâ€™s core code has grown so large that tracking and documenting every incompatibility is not an effective use of resources.

It has proven more effective to discuss compatibility issues during the [**weekly add-on developer call** or on the **add-on developer mailing list**](../community.md). These forums allow developers to raise questions, share experiences, and collaborate on solutions with the community.
