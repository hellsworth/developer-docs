## Thunderbird Release Channels

Thunderbird provides releases through four distinct channels, each serving a unique purpose. Below are the channels, their corresponding branches, and a summary of their purpose:

- **Thunderbird Daily (comm-central)**: Where development and testing begin, and new features are developed.
- **Thunderbird Beta (comm-beta)**: The monthly stabilization release.
- **Thunderbird Release (comm-release)**: The official monthly release.
- **Thunderbird ESR (comm-esr)**: The official annual extended support release.

These four channels offer increasing levels of stability, increasing as code moves from Daily to Beta and being the highest in Release and ESR.
