## Tracking Fixes for Releases

If you believe a bug needs to be addressed in a release, follow these steps:

1. **Set the Tracking Flag**
   - Use `?` to nominate the bug for tracking for the specific Thunderbird version
   - Provide a justification explaining why the bug needs to be addressed in the release.

2. **Mark the Status Flag**
   - Set the corresponding version status flag to `affected`.

Release Management will review bugs nominated for tracking. If they agree that the bug requires investigation for the release, they will change the tracking flag from `?` to `+`.
