## Contributing to Release Notes

Release notes are an essential part of keeping our users informed. If you believe your knowledge can enhance the release notes, we encourage developers to contribute suggested release notes alongside their patch fixes.

### **How to Contribute**
1. **Write Effective Release Notes**
   - Refer to [existing release notes](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/releases/) as examples.
   - Follow [this guide](https://jfx2006.github.io/thunderbird-ci-docs/documentation/drivers/releasenotes/) on how to write brief, clear, and user-focused release notes.

2. **Suggest a Release Note**
   - Set the `relnote-thunderbird` tracking flag in Bugzilla to `?`. This will provide a template to write your note and will nominate it for inclusion in the release notes.

### **Why This Matters**
- Contributing release notes is especially valuable for changes that land in comm-central. During the merge from comm-central to comm-beta, hundreds of commits are often reviewed, and release note suggestions help to make this process more efficient and accurate.
- By contributing, you help ensure that our users remain informed about new features, fixes, and changes.
